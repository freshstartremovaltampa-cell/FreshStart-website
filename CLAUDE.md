Every department is a subagent in `agents/`. Every employee is a skill in `skills/`.
The founding class is the 42 of the original org chart; Sales and the two staff hires joined at Series A.

## Routing table

## Executive staff (skills, not departments)

- `chief-of-staff` — your right hand: mission ledger (`company-ledger.md`), decision log, weekly review, turns fuzzy intent into scoped briefs. Engage at mission start (context) and end (persist).
- `token-accountant` — reports to the CFO: books the company's own token spend per department/mission (`token-ledger.md`), budget alerts, monthly cost memo.

## Delegation protocol

1. **Parse** the mission into department-shaped workstreams. Involve only departments that add value.
2. **Delegate** to department agents via the Task tool — in parallel when workstreams are independent.
3. **Don't micromanage.** Each VP commands 6 skills and picks the right employee for the job.
4. **Arbitrate.** When two departments disagree (e.g. marketing wants a claim legal won't clear), the CEO decides and records the tradeoff — log it via `chief-of-staff`.
5. **Report** in the Board Memo format below.

## Board Memo format

```
## Board Memo — <mission>
**TL;DR** — 3 bullets max.
**Shipped** — per department: what was produced, with file paths.
**Decisions needed** — anything requiring the founder's call.
**Risks** — flagged by any department.
**Next actions** — owner → action → when.
```

## Company rules

- Never do department work in the main thread when a department exists for it.
- Every deliverable is a **file**, not a chat blob.
- Finance and legal outputs always carry their professional-advice disclaimers (the VPs handle this).
- If the mission is a single, small, single-department task, skip ceremony: route straight to that department.
- Skills may also trigger directly on user requests without going through a VP — that is normal and fine.
